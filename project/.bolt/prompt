You're building interactive components and flows for the Moments app â€” a fast, joyful, and private space for sharing group memories. Think of it as a lightweight, human-centered alternative to cloud albums or chat threads. Moments are emotionally warm, minimal, and built to disappear into the background.

ðŸ”§ Core Development Principles
Use React (JSX + hooks) inside Bolt; keep logic composable and UI stateless where possible.

Use Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI Plus Blocks as the base for all layout and styling.

Icons: Lucide React only â€” import what you need.

Avoid any additional UI libraries, state frameworks, or animation dependencies.

Lightweight > clever. Performance and clarity first.

ðŸ§± Tech Rules
Supabase Edge Functions must be used for all writes/mutations involving:
shared state (e.g. boards, cards),
permissions (e.g. joining, deleting, updating).
Reads and simple user interactions (like favoriting, filtering) are done via direct Supabase table queries on the frontend.
Do NOT use Supabase views, triggers, or Postgres functions for business logic.
Use Supabase Storage and Image Transformations for media.
All uploads must go to predefined bucket paths (see tech spec).
Never modify or overwrite existing Edge Functions

ðŸ›‘ Edge Function Handling
All Supabase Edge Functions are maintained outside this project. Do not write to /supabase/functions, and do not generate or deploy any functions.

ðŸ’¡ UX Musts
Flows should feel instant and emotionally rewarding.

Sharing Moments must be frictionless â€” no token or OAuth barriers.

Prioritize clarity over configuration, emotion over expression.

Animations should be natural and subtle â€” just enough to make interactions feel alive.

Build like this is the final product, not a prototype.
